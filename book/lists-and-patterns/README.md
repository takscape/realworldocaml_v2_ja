# Lists and Patterns

This chapter will focus on two common elements of programming in OCaml: lists
and pattern matching. Both of these were discussed in
[A Guided Tour](guided-tour.html#a-guided-tour){data-type=xref}, but we'll
go into more depth here, presenting the two topics together and using one to
help illustrate the other.

## List Basics

An OCaml list is an immutable, finite sequence of elements of the same type.
As we've seen, OCaml lists can be generated using a bracket-and-semicolon
notation:[lists/generation of]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# open Base;;
# [1;2;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
```

\noindent
And they can also be generated using the equivalent `::`
notation:[operators/: : operator]{.idx}[lists/operator : :]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# 1 :: (2 :: (3 :: []));;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
```

As you can see, the `::` operator is right-associative, which means that we
can build up lists without parentheses. The empty list `[]` is used to
terminate a list. Note that the empty list is polymorphic, meaning it can be
used with elements of any type, as you can see here:

```ocaml env=main
# let empty = [];;
val empty : 'a list = []
# 3 :: empty;;
- : int list = [3]
# "three" :: empty;;
- : string list = ["three"]
```

The way in which the `::` operator attaches elements to the front of a list
reflects the fact that OCaml's lists are in fact singly linked lists. The
figure below is a rough graphical representation of how the list
`1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []` is laid out as a data structure. The final arrow (from
the box containing `3`) points to the empty list.[lists/structure of]{.idx}

\
![](images/lists-and-patterns/lists_layout.png "Lists layout")
\

Each `::` essentially adds a new block to the preceding picture. Such a block
contains two things: a reference to the data in that list element, and a
reference to the remainder of the list. This is why `::` can extend a list
without modifying it; extension allocates a new list element but does not
change any of the existing ones, as you can see:[lists/extension of]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let l = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [];;
val l : int list = [1; 2; 3]
# let m = 0 :: l;;
val m : int list = [0; 1; 2; 3]
# l;;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
```

## Using Patterns to Extract Data from a List

We can read data out of a list using a `match` expression. Here's a
simple example of a recursive function that computes the sum of all
elements of a list:[match expressions]{.idx}[pattern
matching/extracting data with]{.idx}[lists/extracting data
from]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let rec sum l =
    match l with
    | [] -> 0
    | hd :: tl -> hd + sum tl;;
val sum : int list -> int = <fun>
# sum [1;2;3];;
- : int = 6
# sum [];;
- : int = 0
```

\noindent
This code follows the convention of using `hd` to represent the first
element (or head) of the list, and `tl` to represent the remainder (or
tail).

The `match` expression in `sum` is really doing two things: first,
it's acting as a case-analysis tool, breaking down the possibilities
into a pattern-indexed list of cases. Second, it lets you name
substructures within the data structure being matched. In this case,
the variables `hd` and `tl` are bound by the pattern that defines the
second case of the match expression. Variables that are bound in this
way can be used in the expression to the right of the arrow for the
pattern in question.

The fact that `match` expressions can be used to bind new variables
can be a source of confusion. To see how, imagine we wanted to write a
function that filtered out from a list all elements equal to a
particular value. You might be tempted to write that code as follows,
but when you do, the compiler will immediately warn you that something
is wrong:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
    match l with
    | [] -> []
    | to_drop :: tl -> drop_value tl to_drop
    | hd :: tl -> hd :: drop_value tl to_drop;;
Line 5, characters 7-15:
Warning 11 [redundant-case]: this match case is unused.
val drop_value : 'a list -> 'a -> 'a list = <fun>
```

\noindent
Moreover, the function clearly does the wrong thing, filtering out all
elements of the list rather than just those equal to the provided value, as
you can see here:

```ocaml env=main
# drop_value [1;2;3] 2;;
- : int list = []
```

\noindent
So, what's going on?

The key observation is that the appearance of `to_drop` in the second case
doesn't imply a check that the first element is equal to the value `to_drop`
that was passed in as an argument to `drop_value`. Instead, it just causes a
new variable `to_drop` to be bound to whatever happens to be in the first
element of the list, shadowing the earlier definition of `to_drop`. The third
case is unused because it is essentially the same pattern as we had in the
second case.

A better way to write this code is not to use pattern matching for
determining whether the first element is equal to `to_drop`, but to
instead use an ordinary `if` expression:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec drop_value l to_drop =
    match l with
    | [] -> []
    | hd :: tl ->
      let new_tl = drop_value tl to_drop in
      if hd = to_drop then new_tl else hd :: new_tl;;
val drop_value : int list -> int -> int list = <fun>
# drop_value [1;2;3] 2;;
- : int list = [1; 3]
```

If we wanted to drop a particular literal value, rather than a value that was
passed in, we could do this using something like our original implementation
of `drop_value`:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec drop_zero l =
    match l with
    | [] -> []
    | 0  :: tl -> drop_zero tl
    | hd :: tl -> hd :: drop_zero tl;;
val drop_zero : int list -> int list = <fun>
# drop_zero [1;2;0;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3]
```

## Limitations (and Blessings) of Pattern Matching

The preceding example highlights an important fact about patterns, which is
that they can't be used to express arbitrary conditions. Patterns can
characterize the layout of a data structure and can even include literals, as
in the `drop_zero` example, but that's where they stop. A pattern can check
if a list has two elements, but it can't check if the first two elements are
equal to each other.[data structures/pattern matching and]{.idx}

You can think of patterns as a specialized sublanguage that can
express a limited (though still quite rich) set of conditions. The
fact that the pattern language is limited turns out to be a good
thing, making it possible to build better support for patterns in the
compiler. In particular, both the efficiency of `match` expressions
and the ability of the compiler to detect errors in matches depend on
the constrained nature of patterns.

### Performance

Naively, you might think that it would be necessary to check each case in a
`match` in sequence to figure out which one fires. If the cases of a match
were guarded by arbitrary code, that would be the case. But OCaml is often
able to generate machine code that jumps directly to the matched case based
on an efficiently chosen set of runtime checks.

As an example, consider the following rather silly functions for
incrementing an integer by one. The first is implemented with a
`match` expression, and the second with a sequence of `if` expressions:

```ocaml env=main
# let plus_one_match x =
    match x with
    | 0 -> 1
    | 1 -> 2
    | 2 -> 3
    | 3 -> 4
    | 4 -> 5
    | 5 -> 6
    | _ -> x + 1;;
val plus_one_match : int -> int = <fun>
# let plus_one_if x =
    if      x = 0 then 1
    else if x = 1 then 2
    else if x = 2 then 3
    else if x = 3 then 4
    else if x = 4 then 5
    else if x = 5 then 6
    else x + 1;;
val plus_one_if : int -> int = <fun>
```

Note the use of `_` in the above match. This is a wildcard pattern that
matches any value, but without binding a variable name to the value in
question.

If you benchmark these functions, you'll see that `plus_one_if` is
considerably slower than `plus_one_match`, and the advantage gets larger as
the number of cases increases. Here, we'll benchmark these functions using
the `core_bench` library, which can be installed by running
`opam install core_bench` from the command line.

```ocaml env=main,non-deterministic=command
# #require "core_bench";;
# open Core_bench;;
# [ Bench.Test.create ~name:"plus_one_match" (fun () ->
        plus_one_match 10)
  ; Bench.Test.create ~name:"plus_one_if" (fun () ->
        plus_one_if 10) ]
  |> Bench.bench;;
Estimated testing time 20s (2 benchmarks x 10s). Change using -quota SECS.
┌────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Name           │ Time/Run │
├────────────────┼──────────┤
│ plus_one_match │  34.86ns │
│ plus_one_if    │  54.89ns │
└────────────────┴──────────┘
- : unit = ()
```

Here's another, less artificial example. We can rewrite the `sum`
function we described earlier in the chapter using an `if` expression
rather than a match.  We can then use the functions `is_empty`,
`hd_exn`, and `tl_exn` from the `List` module to deconstruct the list,
allowing us to implement the entire function without pattern matching:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec sum_if l =
    if List.is_empty l then 0
    else List.hd_exn l + sum_if (List.tl_exn l);;
val sum_if : int list -> int = <fun>
```

Again, we can benchmark these to see the difference:

```ocaml env=main,non-deterministic=command
# let numbers = List.range 0 1000 in
  [ Bench.Test.create ~name:"sum_if" (fun () -> sum_if numbers)
  ; Bench.Test.create ~name:"sum"    (fun () -> sum numbers) ]
  |> Bench.bench;;
Estimated testing time 20s (2 benchmarks x 10s). Change using -quota SECS.
┌────────┬──────────┐
│ Name   │ Time/Run │
├────────┼──────────┤
│ sum_if │  62.00us │
│ sum    │  17.99us │
└────────┴──────────┘
- : unit = ()
```

In this case, the `match`-based implementation is many times faster
than the `if`-based implementation. The difference comes because we
need to effectively do the same work multiple times, since each
function we call has to reexamine the first element of the list to
determine whether or not it's the empty cell. With a `match`
expression, this work happens exactly once per list element.

This is a more general phenomenon: pattern matching is very efficient,
and is usually faster than what you might write yourself.

### Detecting Errors

The error-detecting capabilities of `match` expressions are if
anything more important than their performance. We've already seen one
example of OCaml's ability to find problems in a pattern match: in our
broken implementation of `drop_value`, OCaml warned us that the final
case was redundant. There are no algorithms for determining if a
predicate written in a general-purpose language is redundant, but it
can be solved reliably in the context of patterns.[match
expressions]{.idx}[errors/detecting with match expressions]{.idx}

OCaml also checks `match` expressions for exhaustiveness. Consider what
happens if we modify `drop_zero` by deleting the handler for one of the
cases. As you can see, the compiler will produce a warning that we've missed
a case, along with an example of an unmatched pattern:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec drop_zero l =
    match l with
    | [] -> []
    | 0  :: tl -> drop_zero tl;;
Lines 2-4, characters 5-31:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
1::_
val drop_zero : int list -> 'a list = <fun>
```

Even for simple examples like this, exhaustiveness checks are pretty useful.
But as we'll see in [Variants](variants.html#variants){data-type=xref},
they become yet more valuable as you get to more complicated examples,
especially those involving user-defined types. In addition to catching
outright errors, they act as a sort of refactoring tool, guiding you to the
locations where you need to adapt your code to deal with changing
types.


## Using the List Module Effectively

We've so far written a fair amount of list-munging code using pattern
matching and recursive functions. In real life, you're usually better off
using the `List` module, which is full of reusable functions that abstract
out common patterns for computing with lists.[tables, creating with List
module]{.idx}[List module/creating tables with]{.idx}[lists/List
module]{.idx}

Let's work through a concrete example.  We'll write a function
`render_table` that, given a list of column headers and a list of
rows, prints them out in a well-formatted text table.  When we're
done, here's how the resulting function should work:

```ocaml skip
# Stdio.print_endline
    (render_table
       ["language";"architect";"first release"]
       [ ["Lisp" ;"John McCarthy" ;"1958"] ;
         ["C"    ;"Dennis Ritchie";"1969"] ;
         ["ML"   ;"Robin Milner"  ;"1973"] ;
         ["OCaml";"Xavier Leroy"  ;"1996"] ;
  ]);;
| language | architect      | first release |
|----------+----------------+---------------|
| Lisp     | John McCarthy  | 1958          |
| C        | Dennis Ritchie | 1969          |
| ML       | Robin Milner   | 1973          |
| OCaml    | Xavier Leroy   | 1996          |
- : unit = ()
```

The first step is to write a function to compute the maximum width of each
column of data. We can do this by converting the header and each row into a
list of integer lengths, and then taking the element-wise max of those lists
of lengths. Writing the code for all of this directly would be a bit of a
chore, but we can do it quite concisely by making use of three functions from
the `List` module: `map`, `map2_exn`, and `fold`.

`List.map` is the simplest to explain. It takes a list and a function for
transforming elements of that list, and returns a new list with the
transformed elements. Thus, we can write:[List module/List.map]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# List.map ~f:String.length ["Hello"; "World!"];;
- : int list = [5; 6]
```

`List.map2_exn` is similar to `List.map`, except that it takes two lists and
a function for combining them. Thus, we might write:[List
module/List.map2_exn]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1];;
- : int list = [3; 2; 3]
```

\noindent
The `_exn` is there because the function throws an exception if the lists are
of mismatched length:

```ocaml env=main
# List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max [1;2;3] [3;2;1;0];;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "length mismatch in map2_exn: 3 <> 4")
```

`List.fold` is the most complicated of the three, taking three arguments: a
list to process, an initial accumulator value, and a function for updating
the accumulator. `List.fold` walks over the list from left to right, updating
the accumulator at each step and returning the final value of the accumulator
when it's done. You can see some of this by looking at the type-signature for
`fold`:[List module/List.fold]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# List.fold;;
- : 'a list -> init:'accum -> f:('accum -> 'a -> 'accum) -> 'accum = <fun>
```

We can use `List.fold` for something as simple as summing up a list:

```ocaml env=main
# List.fold ~init:0 ~f:(+) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 10
```

\noindent
This example is particularly simple because the accumulator and the list
elements are of the same type. But `fold` is not limited to such cases. We
can for example use `fold` to reverse a list, in which case the accumulator
is itself a list:

```ocaml env=main
# List.fold ~init:[] ~f:(fun acc hd -> hd :: acc) [1;2;3;4];;
- : int list = [4; 3; 2; 1]
```

Let's bring our three functions together to compute the maximum column
widths:

```ocaml env=main
# let max_widths header rows =
    let lengths l = List.map ~f:String.length l in
    List.fold rows
      ~init:(lengths header)
      ~f:(fun acc row ->
          List.map2_exn ~f:Int.max acc (lengths row));;
val max_widths : string list -> string list list -> int list = <fun>
```

Using `List.map` we define the function `lengths`, which converts a list of
strings to a list of integer lengths. `List.fold` is then used to iterate
over the rows, using `map2_exn` to take the max of the accumulator with the
lengths of the strings in each row of the table, with the accumulator
initialized to the lengths of the header row.

Now that we know how to compute column widths, we can write the code to
generate the line that separates the header from the rest of the text table.
We'll do this in part by mapping `String.make` over the lengths of the
columns to generate a string of dashes of the appropriate length. We'll then
join these sequences of dashes together using `String.concat`, which
concatenates a list of strings with an optional separator string, and
`^`, which is a pairwise string concatenation function, to add the delimiters
on the outside:

```ocaml env=main
# let render_separator widths =
    let pieces = List.map widths
        ~f:(fun w -> String.make w '-')
    in
    "|-" ^ String.concat ~sep:"-+-" pieces ^ "-|";;
val render_separator : int list -> string = <fun>
# render_separator [3;6;2];;
- : string = "|-----+--------+----|"
```

\noindent
Note that we make the line of dashes two larger than the provided
width to provide some whitespace around each entry in the
table.[strings/concatenation of]{.idx}[String.concat]{.idx}[List
module/String.concat and]{.idx}

::: {data-type=note}
#### Performance of `String.concat` and `^`

In the preceding code we’ve concatenated strings two different ways:
`String.concat`, which operates on lists of strings; and `^`, which is
a pairwise operator. You should avoid `^` for joining large numbers of
strings, since it allocates a new string every time it runs. Thus, the
following code

```ocaml env=main
# let s = "." ^ "."  ^ "."  ^ "."  ^ "."  ^ "."  ^ ".";;
val s : string = "......."
```

\noindent
will allocate strings of length 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, whereas this code

```ocaml env=main
# let s = String.concat [".";".";".";".";".";".";"."];;
val s : string = "......."
```

\noindent
allocates one string of size 7, as well as a list of length 7. At these small
sizes, the differences don't amount to much, but for assembling large
strings, it can be a serious performance issue.
:::

Now we need code for rendering a row with data in it. We'll first write a
function called `pad`, for padding out a string to a specified
length:[strings/padding of]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let pad s length =
    s ^ String.make (length - String.length s) ' ';;
val pad : string -> int -> string = <fun>
# pad "hello" 10;;
- : string = "hello     "
```

We can render a row of data by merging together the padded strings. Again,
we'll use `List.map2_exn` for combining the list of data in the row with the
list of widths:

```ocaml env=main
# let render_row row widths =
    let padded = List.map2_exn row widths ~f:pad in
    "| " ^ String.concat ~sep:" | " padded ^ " |";;
val render_row : string list -> int list -> string = <fun>
# render_row ["Hello";"World"] [10;15];;
- : string = "| Hello      | World           |"
```

Finally, we can bring this all together to build the `render_table`
function we wanted at the start!

```ocaml env=main
# let render_table header rows =
    let widths = max_widths header rows in
    String.concat ~sep:"\n"
      (render_row header widths
       :: render_separator widths
       :: List.map rows ~f:(fun row -> render_row row widths)
      );;
val render_table : string list -> string list list -> string = <fun>
```

### More Useful List Functions

The previous example touched on only three of the functions in
`List`. We won't cover the entire interface (for that you should look
at the [online docs](https://v3.ocaml.org/p/base/v0.14.3/doc/Base/List/index.html)),
but a few more functions are useful enough to mention here.

#### Combining List Elements with `List.reduce`

`List.fold`, which we described earlier, is a very general and powerful
function. Sometimes, however, you want something simpler and easier to use.
One such function is `List.reduce`, which is essentially a specialized
version of `List.fold` that doesn't require an explicit starting value, and
whose accumulator has to consume and produce values of the same type as the
elements of the list it applies to.[elements/combining with
List.reduce]{.idx}[List module/List.reduce]{.idx}[lists/combining elements
in]{.idx}

Here's the type signature:

```ocaml env=main
# List.reduce;;
- : 'a list -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a option = <fun>
```

\noindent
`reduce` returns an optional result, returning `None` when the input
list is empty.

Now we can see `reduce` in action:

```ocaml env=main
# List.reduce ~f:(+) [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : int option = Some 15
# List.reduce ~f:(+) [];;
- : int option = None
```

#### Filtering with `List.filter` and `List.filter_map` {#filtering-with-list.filter-and-list.filter_map}

Very often when processing lists, you want to restrict your attention
to a subset of the values on your list. The `List.filter` function is
one way of doing that:[lists/filtering values
in]{.idx}[values/filtering with List.filter]{.idx}[List
module/List.filter]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# List.filter ~f:(fun x -> x % 2 = 0) [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : int list = [2; 4]
```

Sometimes, you want to both transform and filter as part of the same
computation. In that case, `List.filter_map` is what you need. The function
passed to `List.filter_map` returns an optional value, and `List.filter_map`
drops all elements for which `None` is returned.

Here's an example. The following function computes a list of file extensions
from a list of files, piping the results through `List.dedup_and_sort` to
return the list with duplicates removed and in sorted order. Note that this
example uses `String.rsplit2` from the String module to split a string on the
rightmost appearance of a given character:[lists/duplicate
removal]{.idx}[duplicates, removing]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let extensions filenames =
    List.filter_map filenames ~f:(fun fname ->
        match String.rsplit2 ~on:'.' fname with
        | None  | Some ("",_) -> None
        | Some (_,ext) ->
          Some ext)
    |> List.dedup_and_sort ~compare:String.compare;;
val extensions : string list -> string list = <fun>
# extensions ["foo.c"; "foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"];;
- : string list = ["c"; "ml"; "mli"]
```

The preceding code is also an example of an or-pattern, which allows
you to have multiple subpatterns within a larger pattern. In this
case, `None | Some ("",_)` is an or-pattern. As we'll see later,
or-patterns can be nested anywhere within larger patterns.

#### Partitioning with `List.partition_tf` {#partitioning-with-list.partition_tf}

Another useful operation that's closely related to filtering is partitioning.
The function `List.partition_tf` takes a list and a function for computing a
Boolean condition on the list elements, and returns two lists. The `tf` in
the name is a mnemonic to remind the user that `true` elements go to the
first list and `false` ones go to the second. Here's an
example:[elements/partitioning with
List.partition_tf]{.idx}[lists/partitioning elements in]{.idx}[List
module/List.partition_tf]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let is_ocaml_source s =
    match String.rsplit2 s ~on:'.' with
    | Some (_,("ml"|"mli")) -> true
    | _ -> false;;
val is_ocaml_source : string -> bool = <fun>
# let (ml_files,other_files) =
  List.partition_tf ["foo.c"; "foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"]  ~f:is_ocaml_source;;
val ml_files : string list = ["foo.ml"; "bar.ml"; "bar.mli"]
val other_files : string list = ["foo.c"]
```

#### Combining lists

Another very common operation on lists is concatenation. The `List` module
actually comes with a few different ways of doing this. There's
`List.append`, for concatenating a pair of lists.
[lists/combining]{.idx}[List module/List.append]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# List.append [1;2;3] [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
```

There's also `@`, an operator equivalent of `List.append`.

```ocaml env=main
# [1;2;3] @ [4;5;6];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
```

In addition, there is `List.concat`, for concatenating a list of lists:

```ocaml env=main
# List.concat [[1;2];[3;4;5];[6];[]];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
```

Here's an example of using `List.concat` along with `List.map` to compute a
recursive listing of a directory tree.

```ocaml env=main
# module Sys = Core.Sys
  module Filename = Core.Filename;;
module Sys = Core.Sys
module Filename = Core.Filename
# let rec ls_rec s =
    if Sys.is_file_exn ~follow_symlinks:true s
    then [s]
    else
      Sys.ls_dir s
      |> List.map ~f:(fun sub -> ls_rec (Filename.concat s sub))
      |> List.concat;;
val ls_rec : string -> string list = <fun>
```

\noindent
Note that this example uses some functions from the `Sys` and
`Filename` modules from `Core` for accessing the filesystem and
dealing with filenames.

The preceding combination of `List.map` and `List.concat` is common enough
that there is a function `List.concat_map` that combines these into one, more
efficient operation:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec ls_rec s =
    if Sys.is_file_exn ~follow_symlinks:true s
    then [s]
    else
      Sys.ls_dir s
      |> List.concat_map ~f:(fun sub -> ls_rec (Filename.concat s sub));;
val ls_rec : string -> string list = <fun>
```

## Tail Recursion

The only way to compute the length of an OCaml list is to walk the list from
beginning to end. As a result, computing the length of a list takes time
linear in the size of the list. Here's a simple function for doing so:[List
module/List.init]{.idx}[lists/computing length of]{.idx}[tail
recursion]{.idx}[recursion/tail recursion]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let rec length = function
    | [] -> 0
    | _ :: tl -> 1 + length tl;;
val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>
# length [1;2;3];;
- : int = 3
```

This looks simple enough, but you'll discover that this implementation runs
into problems on very large lists, as we'll show in the following code:

```ocaml env=main
# let make_list n = List.init n ~f:(fun x -> x);;
val make_list : int -> int list = <fun>
# length (make_list 10);;
- : int = 10
# length (make_list 10_000_000);;
Stack overflow during evaluation (looping recursion?).
```

The preceding example creates lists using `List.init`, which takes an integer
`n` and a function `f` and creates a list of length `n`, where the data for
each element is created by calling `f` on the index of that element.

To understand where the error in the above example comes from, you need to
learn a bit more about how function calls work. Typically, a function call
needs some space to keep track of information associated with the call, such
as the arguments passed to the function, or the location of the code that
needs to start executing when the function call is complete. To allow for
nested function calls, this information is typically organized in a stack,
where a new *stack frame* is allocated for each nested function call, and
then deallocated when the function call is complete.[stack frames]{.idx}

And that's the problem with our call to `length`: it tried to allocate 10
million stack frames, which exhausted the available stack space. Happily,
there's a way around this problem. Consider the following alternative
implementation:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec length_plus_n l n =
    match l with
    | [] -> n
    | _ :: tl -> length_plus_n tl (n + 1);;
val length_plus_n : 'a list -> int -> int = <fun>
# let length l = length_plus_n l 0;;
val length : 'a list -> int = <fun>
# length [1;2;3;4];;
- : int = 4
```

This implementation depends on a helper function, `length_plus_n`, that
computes the length of a given list plus a given `n`. In practice, `n` acts
as an accumulator in which the answer is built up, step by step. As a result,
we can do the additions along the way rather than doing them as we unwind the
nested sequence of function calls, as we did in our first implementation of
`length`.

The advantage of this approach is that the recursive call in `length_plus_n`
is a *tail call*. We'll explain more precisely what it means to be a tail
call shortly, but the reason it's important is that tail calls don't require
the allocation of a new stack frame, due to what is called the
*tail-call optimization*. A recursive function is said to be *tail recursive*
if all of its recursive calls are tail calls. `length_plus_n` is indeed tail
recursive, and as a result, `length` can take a long list as input without
blowing the stack:[tail calls]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# length (make_list 10_000_000);;
- : int = 10000000
```

So when is a call a tail call? Let's think about the situation where one
function (the *caller*) invokes another (the *callee*). The invocation is
considered a tail call when the caller doesn't do anything with the value
returned by the callee except to return it. The tail-call optimization makes
sense because, when a caller makes a tail call, the caller's stack frame need
never be used again, and so you don't need to keep it around. Thus, instead
of allocating a new stack frame for the callee, the compiler is free to reuse
the caller's stack frame.

Tail recursion is important for more than just lists. Ordinary non-tail
recursive calls are reasonable when dealing with data structures like binary
trees, where the depth of the tree is logarithmic in the size of your data.
But when dealing with situations where the depth of the sequence of nested
calls is on the order of the size of your data, tail recursion is usually the
right approach.

## Terser and Faster Patterns

Now that we know more about how lists and patterns work, let's
consider how we can improve on an example from [Recursive List
Functions](guided-tour.html#recursive-list-functions){data-type=xref}:
the function `remove_sequential_duplicates`.  Here's the
implementation that was described earlier: [pattern matching/terser
and faster patterns]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
    match list with
    | [] -> []
    | [x] -> [x]
    | first :: second :: tl ->
      if first = second then
        remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl)
      else
        first :: remove_sequential_duplicates (second :: tl);;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
```

We'll consider some ways of making this code more concise and more efficient.

First, let's consider efficiency. One problem with the above code is
that it in some cases re-creates on the right-hand side of the arrow a
value that already existed on the left-hand side. Thus, the pattern
`[hd] -> [hd]` actually allocates a new list element, when really, it
should be able to just return the list being matched. We can reduce
allocation here by using an `as` pattern, which allows us to declare a
name for the thing matched by a pattern or subpattern. While we're at
it, we'll use the `function` keyword to eliminate the need for an
explicit match:[function keyword]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates = function
    | [] as l -> l
    | [_] as l -> l
    | first :: (second :: _ as tl) ->
      if first = second then
        remove_sequential_duplicates tl
      else
        first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
```

We can further collapse this by combining the first two cases into
one, using an *or-pattern*:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
    match list with
    | [] | [_] as l -> l
    | first :: (second :: _ as tl) ->
      if first = second then
        remove_sequential_duplicates tl
      else
        first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
```

We can make the code slightly terser now by using a `when` clause. A
`when` clause allows us to add an extra precondition to a pattern in the form
of an arbitrary OCaml expression. In this case, we can use it to include the
check on whether the first two elements are equal:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
    match list with
    | [] | [_] as l -> l
    | first :: (second :: _ as tl) when first = second ->
      remove_sequential_duplicates tl
    | first :: tl -> first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : int list -> int list = <fun>
```

::: {data-type=note}
#### Polymorphic Compare

You might have noticed that `remove_sequential_duplicates` is
specialized to lists of integers.  That's because `Base`'s default
equality operator is specialized to integers, as you can see if you
try to apply it to values of a different type.
[polymorphic compare]{.idx}

```ocaml env=poly
# open Base;;
# "foo" = "bar";;
Line 1, characters 1-6:
Error: This expression has type string but an expression was expected of type
         int
```

OCaml also has a collection of polymorphic equality and comparison operators,
which we can make available by opening the module `Base.Poly`.
[Base.Poly]{.idx}

```ocaml env=poly
# open Base.Poly;;
# "foo" = "bar";;
- : bool = false
# 3 = 4;;
- : bool = false
# [1;2;3] = [1;2;3];;
- : bool = true
```

Indeed, if we look at the type of the equality operator, we'll see that it is
polymorphic.

```ocaml env=poly
# (=);;
- : 'a -> 'a -> bool = <fun>
```

If we rewrite `remove_sequential_duplicates` with `Base.Poly` open,
we'll see that it gets a polymorphic type, and can now be used on
inputs of different types.

```ocaml env=poly
# let rec remove_sequential_duplicates list =
    match list with
    | [] | [_] as l -> l
    | first :: (second :: _ as tl) when first = second ->
      remove_sequential_duplicates tl
    | first :: tl -> first :: remove_sequential_duplicates tl;;
val remove_sequential_duplicates : 'a list -> 'a list = <fun>
# remove_sequential_duplicates [1;2;2;3;4;3;3];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 3]
# remove_sequential_duplicates ["one";"two";"two";"two";"three"];;
- : string list = ["one"; "two"; "three"]
```

OCaml comes with a whole family of polymorphic comparison operators,
including the standard infix comparators, `<`, `>=`, etc., as well as
the function `compare` that returns `-1`, `0`, or `1` to flag whether
the first operand is smaller than, equal to, or greater than the
second, respectively.

You might wonder how you could build functions like these yourself if
OCaml didn't come with them built in. It turns out that you *can't*
build these functions on your own. OCaml's polymorphic comparison
functions are built into the runtime to a low level. These comparisons
are polymorphic on the basis of ignoring almost everything about the
types of the values that are being compared, paying attention only to
the structure of the values as they're laid out in memory. (You can
learn more about this structure in [Memory Representation of
Values](runtime-memory-layout.html#memory-representation-of-values){data-type=xref}.)

Polymorphic compare does have some limitations. For example, it will
fail at runtime if it encounters a function value.

```ocaml env=poly
# (fun x -> x + 1) = (fun x -> x + 1);;
Exception: (Invalid_argument "compare: functional value")
```

Similarly, it will fail on values that come from outside the OCaml
heap, like values from C bindings. But it will work in a reasonable
way for most other kinds of values.

For simple atomic types, polymorphic compare has the semantics you
would expect: for floating-point numbers and integers, polymorphic
compare corresponds to the expected numerical comparison
functions. For strings, it's a lexicographic comparison.

That said, experienced OCaml developers typically avoid polymorphic
comparison. That's surprising, given how obviously useful it is, but
there's a good reason. While it's very convenient, in some cases, the
type oblivious nature of polymorphic compare means that it does
something that doesn't make sense for the particular type of values
you're dealing with. This can lead to surprising and hard to resolve
bugs in your code. It's for this reason that `Base` discourages the
use of polymorphic compare by hiding it by default.

We'll discuss the downsides of polymorphic compare in more detail in
[Maps And Hash
Tables](maps-and-hashtables.html#maps-and-hash-tables){data-type=xref}.

:::

Note that `when` clauses have some downsides. As we noted earlier, the static
checks associated with pattern matches rely on the fact that patterns are
restricted in what they can express. Once we add the ability to add an
arbitrary condition to a pattern, something is lost. In particular, the
ability of the compiler to determine if a match is exhaustive, or if some
case is redundant, is compromised.

Consider the following function, which takes a list of optional values, and
returns the number of those values that are `Some`. Because this
implementation uses `when` clauses, the compiler can't tell that the code is
exhaustive:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec count_some list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
    | x :: tl when Option.is_some x -> 1 + count_some tl;;
Lines 2-5, characters 5-57:
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
_::_
(However, some guarded clause may match this value.)
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
```

Despite the warning, the function does work fine:

```ocaml env=main
# count_some [Some 3; None; Some 4];;
- : int = 2
```

If we add another redundant case without a `when` clause, the compiler will
stop complaining about exhaustiveness and won't produce a warning about the
redundancy.

```ocaml env=main
# let rec count_some list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
    | x :: tl when Option.is_some x -> 1 + count_some tl
    | x :: tl -> -1 (* unreachable *);;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
```

\noindent
Probably a better approach is to simply drop the second `when` clause:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec count_some list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x :: tl when Option.is_none x -> count_some tl
    | _ :: tl -> 1 + count_some tl;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
```

This is a little less clear, however, than the direct pattern-matching
solution, where the meaning of each pattern is clearer on its own:

```ocaml env=main
# let rec count_some list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | None   :: tl -> count_some tl
    | Some _ :: tl -> 1 + count_some tl;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
```

The takeaway from all of this is although `when` clauses can be useful, we
should prefer patterns wherever they are sufficient.

As a side note, the above implementation of `count_some` is longer than
necessary; even worse, it is not tail recursive. In real life, you would
probably just use the `List.count` function:

```ocaml env=main
# let count_some l = List.count ~f:Option.is_some l;;
val count_some : 'a option list -> int = <fun>
```
