# Files, Modules, and Programs

We've so far experienced OCaml largely through the toplevel. As you move from
exercises to real-world programs, you'll need to leave the toplevel behind
and start building programs from files. Files are more than just a convenient
way to store and manage your code; in OCaml, they also correspond to modules,
which act as boundaries that divide your program into conceptual units.

In this chapter, we'll show you how to build an OCaml program from a
collection of files, as well as the basics of working with modules and module
signatures.

## Single-File Programs

We'll start with an example: a utility that reads lines from `stdin`,
computes a frequency count of the lines, and prints out the ten most frequent
lines. We'll start with a simple implementation, which we'll save as the file
*freq.ml*. [files/single-file
programs]{.idx}[programs/single-file programs]{.idx}

This implementation will use two functions from the `List.Assoc` module,
which provides utility functions for interacting with *association lists*,
*i.e.*, lists of key/value pairs. In particular, we use the function
`List.Assoc.find`, which looks up a key in an association list; and
`List.Assoc.add`, which adds a new binding to an association list, as shown
here: [List.Assoc module/List.Assoc.add]{.idx}[List.Assoc
module/List.Assoc.find]{.idx}[lists/adding new bindings
in]{.idx}[lists/finding key associations in]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# open Base;;
# let assoc = [("one", 1); ("two",2); ("three",3)];;
val assoc : (string * int) list = [("one", 1); ("two", 2); ("three", 3)]
# List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal assoc "two";;
- : int option = Some 2
# List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal assoc "four" 4;;
- : (string, int) Base.List.Assoc.t =
[("four", 4); ("one", 1); ("two", 2); ("three", 3)]
# List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal assoc "two"  4;;
- : (string, int) Base.List.Assoc.t = [("two", 4); ("one", 1); ("three", 3)]
```

\noindent
Note that `List.Assoc.add` doesn't modify the original list, but instead
allocates a new list with the requisite key/value pair added.

Now we can write `freq.ml`.

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq/freq.ml
open Base
open Stdio

let build_counts () =
  In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:(fun counts line ->
      let count =
        match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
        | None -> 0
        | Some x -> x
      in
      List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1))

let () =
  build_counts ()
  |> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
  |> (fun l -> List.take l 10)
  |> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
```

The function `build_counts` reads in lines from `stdin`, constructing from
those lines an association list with the frequencies of each line. It does
this by invoking `In_channel.fold_lines` (similar to the function `List.fold`
described in
[Lists And Patterns](lists-and-patterns.html#lists-and-patterns){data-type=xref}),
which reads through the lines one by one, calling the provided `fold`
function for each line to update the accumulator. That accumulator is
initialized to the empty list.

With `build_counts` defined, we then call the function to build the
association list, sort that list by frequency in descending order,
grab the first 10 elements off the list, and then iterate over those
10 elements and print them to the screen. These operations are tied
together using the `|>` operator described in [Variables And
Functions](variables-and-functions.html#prefix-and-infix-operators){data-type=xref}.
[main function]{.idx}

#### Where Is `main`?

Unlike programs in C, Java or C#, programs in OCaml don't have a unique
`main` function. When an OCaml program is evaluated, all the statements in
the implementation files are evaluated in the order in which they were linked
together. These implementation files can contain arbitrary expressions, not
just function definitions. In this example, the declaration starting with
`let () =` plays the role of the `main` function, kicking off the processing.
But really the entire file is evaluated at startup, and so in some sense the
full codebase is one big `main` function.

The idiom of writing `let () =` may seem a bit odd, but it has a purpose. The
`let` binding here is a pattern-match to a value of type `unit`, which is
there to ensure that the expression on the right-hand side returns `unit`, as
is common for functions that operate primarily by side effect.
:::


If we weren't using `Base` or any other external libraries, we could build
the executable like this:

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq
$ ocamlopt freq.ml -o freq
File "freq.ml", line 1, characters 5-9:
1 | open Base
         ^^^^
Error: Unbound module Base
[2]
```

\noindent
But as you can see, it fails because it can't find `Base` and `Stdio`. We
need a somewhat more complex invocation to get them linked in: [OCaml
toolchain/ocamlc]{.idx}[OCaml toolchain/ocamlfind]{.idx}[Base standard
library/finding with ocamlfind]{.idx}

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq
$ ocamlfind ocamlopt -linkpkg -package base -package stdio freq.ml -o freq
```

This uses `ocamlfind`, a tool which itself invokes other parts of the
OCaml toolchain (in this case, `ocamlopt`) with the appropriate flags to
link in particular libraries and packages. Here, `-package base` is
asking `ocamlfind` to link in the `Base` library; `-linkpkg` asks
ocamlfind to link in the packages as is necessary for building an
executable. [linkpkg]{.idx}

While this works well enough for a one-file project, more complicated
projects require a tool to orchestrate the build. One good tool for
this task is `dune`. To invoke `dune`, you need to have two files: a
`dune-project` file for the overall project, and a `dune` file that
configures the particular directory.  This is a single-directory
project, so we'll just have one of each, but more realistic projects
will have one `dune-project` and many `dune` files. [dune]{.idx}
[dune-project]{.idx}

At its simplest, the `dune-project` just specifies the version of the
`dune` configuration-language in use.

```scheme file=examples/correct/freq-dune/dune-project
(lang dune 3.0)
```

\noindent
We also need a `dune` file to declare the executable we want to build,
along with the libraries it depends on.

```scheme file=examples/correct/freq-dune/dune
(executable
  (name      freq)
  (libraries base stdio))
```

\noindent
With that in place, we can invoke `dune` as follows.

```sh dir=examples/correct/freq-dune
$ dune build freq.exe
```

We can run the resulting executable, `freq.exe`, from the command
line.  Executables built with `dune` will be left in the
`_build/default` directory, from which they can be invoked.  The
specific invocation below will count the words that come up in the
file `freq.ml` itself. [OCaml toolchain/dune]{.idx}

```sh dir=examples/correct/freq-dune
$ grep -Eo '[[:alpha:]]+' freq.ml | ./_build/default/freq.exe
  5: line
  5: List
  5: counts
  4: count
  4: fun
  4: x
  4: equal
  3: let
  2: f
  2: l
```

Conveniently, `dune` allows us to combine the building and running an
executable into a single operation, which we can do using `dune exec`.

```sh dir=examples/correct/freq-dune
$ grep -Eo '[[:alpha:]]+' freq.ml | dune exec ./freq.exe
  5: line
  5: List
  5: counts
  4: count
  4: fun
  4: x
  4: equal
  3: let
  2: f
  2: l
```

We've really just scratched the surface of what can be done with
`dune`.  We'll discuss `dune` in more detail in [The OCaml
Platform](platform.html#the-ocaml-platform){data-type=xref}.


::: {data-type=note}
#### Bytecode Versus Native Code

OCaml ships with two compilers: the `ocamlopt` native code compiler
and the `ocamlc` bytecode compiler.  Programs compiled with `ocamlc`
are interpreted by a virtual machine, while programs compiled with
`ocamlopt` are compiled to machine code to be run on a specific
operating system and processor architecture. With `dune`, targets
ending with `.bc` are built as bytecode executables, and those ending
with `.exe` are built as native code.

Aside from performance, executables generated by the two compilers
have nearly identical behavior. There are a few things to be aware
of. First, the bytecode compiler can be used on more architectures,
and has some tools that are not available for native code. For
example, the OCaml debugger only works with bytecode (although `gdb`,
the GNU Debugger, works with some limitations on OCaml native-code
applications). The bytecode compiler is also quicker than the
native-code compiler. In addition, in order to run a bytecode
executable, you typically need to have OCaml installed on the system
in question. That's not strictly required, though, since you can build
a bytecode executable with an embedded runtime, using the `-custom`
compiler flag.

As a general matter, production executables should usually be built
using the native-code compiler, but it sometimes makes sense to use
bytecode for development builds. And, of course, bytecode makes sense
when targeting a platform not supported by the native-code
compiler. We'll cover both compilers in more detail in [The Compiler
Backend: Byte Code And Native
Code](compiler-backend.html#the-compiler-backend-byte-code-and-native-code){data-type=xref}.

## Multifile Programs and Modules {#multi-file-programs-and-modules}

Source files in OCaml are tied into the module system, with each file
compiling down into a module whose name is derived from the name of the file.
We've encountered modules before, such as when we used functions like
`find` and `add` from the `List.Assoc` module. At its simplest, you can think
of a module as a collection of definitions that are stored within a
namespace. [modules/basics of]{.idx}[files/multi-file
programs]{.idx}[programs/multi-file programs]{.idx}

Let's consider how we can use modules to refactor the implementation of
`freq.ml`. Remember that the variable `counts` contains an association list
representing the counts of the lines seen so far. But updating an association
list takes time linear in the length of the list, meaning that the time
complexity of processing a file is quadratic in the number of distinct lines
in the file.

We can fix this problem by replacing association lists with a more efficient
data structure. To do that, we'll first factor out the key functionality into
a separate module with an explicit interface. We can consider alternative
(and more efficient) implementations once we have a clear interface to
program against.

We'll start by creating a file, `counter.ml`, that contains the logic for
maintaining the association list used to represent the frequency counts. The
key function, called `touch`, bumps the frequency count of a given line by
one.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-with-counter/counter.ml
open Base

let touch counts line =
  let count =
    match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
    | None -> 0
    | Some x -> x
  in
  List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1)
```

The file *counter.ml* will be compiled into a module named `Counter`, where
the name of the module is derived automatically from the filename. The module
name is capitalized even if the file is not. Indeed, module names are always
capitalized. [modules/naming of]{.idx}

We can now rewrite `freq.ml` to use `Counter`.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-with-counter/freq.ml
open Base
open Stdio

let build_counts () =
  In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:Counter.touch

let () =
  build_counts ()
  |> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
  |> (fun l -> List.take l 10)
  |> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
```

The resulting code can still be built with `dune`, which will discover
dependencies and realize that `counter.ml` needs to be compiled.

```sh dir=examples/correct/freq-with-counter
$ dune build freq.exe
```

## Signatures and Abstract Types

While we've pushed some of the logic to the `Counter` module, the code in
`freq.ml` can still depend on the details of the implementation of `Counter`.
Indeed, if you look at the definition of `build_counts`, you'll see that it
depends on the fact that the empty set of frequency counts is represented as
an empty list. We'd like to prevent this kind of dependency, so we can change
the implementation of `Counter` without needing to change client code like
that in `freq.ml`. [abstract types]{.idx}[modules/module
type]{.idx}[signatures/abstract types]{.idx}[interfaces/hiding implementation
details with]{.idx}[modules/hiding implementation details]{.idx}

The implementation details of a module can be hidden by attaching an
*interface*. (Note that in the context of OCaml, the terms *interface*,
*signature*, and *module type* are all used interchangeably.) A module
defined by a file `filename.ml` can be constrained by a signature placed in a
file called `filename.mli`. [interfaces/synonyms for]{.idx}

For `counter.mli`, we'll start by writing down an interface that describes
what's currently available in `counter.ml`, without hiding anything.
`val` declarations are used to specify values in a signature. The syntax of a
`val` declaration is as follows:

```
val <identifier> : <type>
```

Using this syntax, we can write the signature of `counter.ml` as follows.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-with-sig/counter.mli
open Base

(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : (string * int) list -> string -> (string * int) list
```

Note that `dune` will detect the presence of the `mli` file automatically
and include it in the build.

To hide the fact that frequency counts are represented as association lists,
we'll need to make the type of frequency counts *abstract*. A type is
abstract if its name is exposed in the interface, but its definition is not.
Here's an abstract interface for `Counter`:

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-with-sig-abstract/counter.mli
open Base

(** A collection of string frequency counts *)
type t

(** The empty set of frequency counts *)
val empty : t

(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : t -> string -> t

(** Converts the set of frequency counts to an association list. A
    string shows up at most once, and the counts are >= 1. *)
val to_list : t -> (string * int) list
```

\noindent
We added `empty` and `to_list` to `Counter`, since without
them there would be no way to create a `Counter.t` or get data out of
one.

We also used this opportunity to document the module. The `mli` file is the
place where you specify your module's interface, and as such is a natural
place to put documentation. We started our comments with a double asterisk to
cause them to be picked up by the `odoc` tool when generating API
documentation. We'll discuss `odoc` more in
[The OCaml Platform](platform.html#browsing-interface-documentation){data-type=xref}.

Here's a rewrite of `counter.ml` to match the new `counter.mli`:

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-with-sig-abstract/counter.ml
open Base

type t = (string * int) list

let empty = []
let to_list x = x

let touch counts line =
  let count =
    match List.Assoc.find ~equal:String.equal counts line with
    | None -> 0
    | Some x -> x
  in
  List.Assoc.add ~equal:String.equal counts line (count + 1)
```

If we now try to compile `freq.ml`, we'll get the following error:

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-with-sig-abstract
$ dune build freq.exe
File "freq.ml", line 5, characters 53-66:
5 |   In_channel.fold_lines In_channel.stdin ~init:[] ~f:Counter.touch
                                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type Counter.t -> Export.string -> Counter.t
       but an expression was expected of type
         'a list -> Export.string -> 'a list
       Type Counter.t is not compatible with type 'a list
[1]
```

This is because `freq.ml` depends on the fact that frequency counts are
represented as association lists, a fact that we've just hidden. We just need
to fix `build_counts` to use `Counter.empty` instead of `[]` and to use
`Counter.to_list` to convert the completed counts to an association list. The
resulting implementation is shown below.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-with-sig-abstract-fixed/freq.ml
open Base
open Stdio

let build_counts () =
  In_channel.fold_lines
    In_channel.stdin
    ~init:Counter.empty
    ~f:Counter.touch

let () =
  build_counts ()
  |> Counter.to_list
  |> List.sort ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) -> Int.descending x y)
  |> (fun counts -> List.take counts 10)
  |> List.iter ~f:(fun (line, count) -> printf "%3d: %s\n" count line)
```

\noindent
With this implementation, the build now succeeds!

```sh dir=examples/correct/freq-with-sig-abstract-fixed
$ dune build freq.exe
```

Now we can turn to optimizing the implementation of `Counter`. Here's
an alternate and far more efficient implementation, based on `Base`'s
`Map` data structure.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-fast/counter.ml
open Base

type t = int Map.M(String).t

let empty = Map.empty (module String)
let to_list t = Map.to_alist t

let touch t s =
  let count =
    match Map.find t s with
    | None -> 0
    | Some x -> x
  in
  Map.set t ~key:s ~data:(count + 1)
```

There's some unfamiliar syntax in the above example, in particular the
use of `int Map.M(String).t` to indicate the type of a map, and
`Map.empty (module String)` to generate an empty map. Here, we're
making use of a more advanced feature of the language (specifically,
functors and first-class modules, which we'll get to in later
chapters). The use of these features for the Map data-structure in
particular is covered in [Maps And Hash
Tables](maps-and-hashtables.html#maps-and-hash-tables){data-type=xref}.

## Concrete Types in Signatures

In our frequency-count example, the module `Counter` had an abstract type
`Counter.t` for representing a collection of frequency counts. Sometimes,
you'll want to make a type in your interface *concrete*, by including the
type definition in the interface. [concrete types]{.idx}[signatures/concrete
types]{.idx}

For example, imagine we wanted to add a function to `Counter` for
returning the line with the median frequency count. If the number of
lines is even, then there is no single median, and the function would
return the lines before and after the median instead. We'll use a
custom type to represent the fact that there are two possible return
values. Here's a possible implementation:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-median/counter.ml,part=1
type median =
  | Median of string
  | Before_and_after of string * string

let median t =
  let sorted_strings =
    List.sort (Map.to_alist t) ~compare:(fun (_, x) (_, y) ->
        Int.descending x y)
  in
  let len = List.length sorted_strings in
  if len = 0 then failwith "median: empty frequency count";
  let nth n = fst (List.nth_exn sorted_strings n) in
  if len % 2 = 1
  then Median (nth (len / 2))
  else Before_and_after (nth ((len / 2) - 1), nth (len / 2))
```

In the above, we use `failwith` to throw an exception for the case of the
empty list. We'll discuss exceptions more in
[Error Handling](error-handling.html#error-handling){data-type=xref}. Note
also that the function `fst` simply returns the first element of any
two-tuple.

Now, to expose this usefully in the interface, we need to expose both the
function and the type `median` with its definition. Note that values (of
which functions are an example) and types have distinct namespaces, so
there's no name clash here. Adding the following two lines to `counter.mli`
does the trick.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-median/counter.mli,part=1
(** Represents the median computed from a set of strings. In the case
    where there is an even number of choices, the one before and after
    the median is returned. *)
type median =
  | Median of string
  | Before_and_after of string * string

val median : t -> median
```

The decision of whether a given type should be abstract or concrete is an
important one. Abstract types give you more control over how values are
created and accessed, and make it easier to enforce invariants beyond what is
enforced by the type itself; concrete types let you expose more detail and
structure to client code in a lightweight way. The right choice depends very
much on the context.

## Nested Modules

Up until now, we've only considered modules that correspond to files, like
`counter.ml`. But modules (and module signatures) can be nested inside other
modules. As a simple example, consider a program that needs to deal with
multiple identifiers like usernames and hostnames. If you just represent
these as strings, then it becomes easy to confuse one with the other.
[identifiers/dealing with multiple]{.idx}[nested
modules]{.idx}[modules/nested modules]{.idx}

A better approach is to mint new abstract types for each identifier, where
those types are under the covers just implemented as strings. That way, the
type system will prevent you from confusing a username with a hostname, and
if you do need to convert, you can do so using explicit conversions to and
from the string type.

Here's how you might create such an abstract type, within a submodule:
[abstract types]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/correct/abstract-username/abstract_username.ml
open Base

module Username : sig
  type t

  val of_string : string -> t
  val to_string : t -> string
  val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool
end = struct
  type t = string

  let of_string x = x
  let to_string x = x
  let ( = ) = String.( = )
end
```

Note that the `to_string` and `of_string` functions above are implemented
simply as the identity function, which means they have no runtime effect.
They are there purely as part of the discipline that they enforce on the code
through the type system. We also chose to put in an equality function, so you
can check if two usernames match. In a real application, we might want more
functionality, like the ability to hash and compare usernames, but we've kept
this example purposefully simple.

The basic structure of a module declaration like this is:

```
module <name> : <signature> = <implementation>
```

We could have written this slightly differently, by giving the signature its
own top-level `module type` declaration, making it possible to create
multiple distinct types with the same underlying implementation in a
lightweight way:

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/session_info/session_info.ml
open Base
module Time = Core.Time

module type ID = sig
  type t

  val of_string : string -> t
  val to_string : t -> string
  val ( = ) : t -> t -> bool
end

module String_id = struct
  type t = string

  let of_string x = x
  let to_string x = x
  let ( = ) = String.( = )
end

module Username : ID = String_id
module Hostname : ID = String_id

type session_info =
  { user : Username.t
  ; host : Hostname.t
  ; when_started : Time.t
  }

let sessions_have_same_user s1 s2 = Username.( = ) s1.user s2.host
```

The preceding code has a bug: it compares the username in one session to the
host in the other session, when it should be comparing the usernames in both
cases. Because of how we defined our types, however, the compiler will flag
this bug for us.

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/session_info
$ dune build session_info.exe
File "session_info.ml", line 29, characters 59-66:
29 | let sessions_have_same_user s1 s2 = Username.( = ) s1.user s2.host
                                                                ^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type Hostname.t
       but an expression was expected of type Username.t
[1]
```

This is a trivial example, but confusing different kinds of identifiers is a
very real source of bugs, and the approach of minting abstract types for
different classes of identifiers is an effective way of avoiding such issues.

## Opening Modules

Most of the time, you refer to values and types within a module by using the
module name as an explicit qualifier. For example, you write `List.map` to
refer to the `map` function in the `List` module. Sometimes, though, you want
to be able to refer to the contents of a module without this explicit
qualification. That's what the `open` statement is for. [identifiers/open
modules and]{.idx}[modules/opening]{.idx}

We've encountered `open` already, specifically where we've written
`open Base` to get access to the standard definitions in the `Base` library.
In general, opening a module adds the contents of that module to the
environment that the compiler looks at to find the definition of various
identifiers. Here's an example:

```ocaml env=main
# module M = struct let foo = 3 end;;
module M : sig val foo : int end
# foo;;
Line 1, characters 1-4:
Error: Unbound value foo
# open M;;
# foo;;
- : int = 3
```

Here's some general advice on how to use `open` effectively.

### Open Modules Rarely

`open` is essential when you're using an alternative standard library
like `Base`, but it's generally good style to keep the opening of
modules to a minimum. Opening a module is basically a trade-off
between terseness and explicitness—the more modules you open, the
fewer module qualifications you need, and the harder it is to look at
an identifier and figure out where it comes from.

When you do use `open`, it should mostly be with modules that were
designed to be opened, like `Base` itself, or `Option.Monad_infix` or
`Float.O` within `Base`..

### Prefer Local Opens

It's generally better to keep down the amount of code affected by an
`open`. One great tool for this is *local open*s, which let you
restrict the scope of an open to an arbitrary expression. There are
two syntaxes for local opens. The following example shows the `let
open` syntax; [local opens]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# let average x y =
    let open Int64 in
    (x + y) / of_int 2;;
val average : int64 -> int64 -> int64 = <fun>
```

Here, `of_int` and the infix operators are the ones from the `Int64`
module.

The following shows off a more lightweight syntax which is
particularly useful for small expressions.

```ocaml env=main
# let average x y =
    Int64.((x + y) / of_int 2);;
val average : int64 -> int64 -> int64 = <fun>
```

### Using Module Shortcuts Instead

An alternative to local `open`s that makes your code terser without
giving up on explicitness is to locally rebind the name of a
module. So, when using the `Counter.median` type, instead of writing:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-median/use_median_1.ml,part=1
let print_median m =
  match m with
  | Counter.Median string -> printf "True median:\n   %s\n" string
  | Counter.Before_and_after (before, after) ->
    printf "Before and after median:\n   %s\n   %s\n" before after
```

you could write:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/freq-median/use_median_2.ml,part=1
let print_median m =
  let module C = Counter in
  match m with
  | C.Median string -> printf "True median:\n   %s\n" string
  | C.Before_and_after (before, after) ->
    printf "Before and after median:\n   %s\n   %s\n" before after
```

Because the module name `C` only exists for a short scope, it's easy
to read and remember what `C` stands for. Rebinding modules to very
short names at the top level of your module is usually a mistake.

## Including Modules

While opening a module affects the environment used to search for
identifiers, *including* a module is a way of adding new identifiers to a
module proper. Consider the following simple module for representing a range
of integer values: [modules/including]{.idx}[identifiers/adding to
modules]{.idx}

```ocaml env=main
# module Interval = struct
    type t = | Interval of int * int
             | Empty

    let create low high =
      if high < low then Empty else Interval (low,high)
  end;;
module Interval :
  sig type t = Interval of int * int | Empty val create : int -> int -> t end
```

We can use the `include` directive to create a new, extended version of the
`Interval` module:

```ocaml env=main
# module Extended_interval = struct
    include Interval

    let contains t x =
      match t with
      | Empty -> false
      | Interval (low,high) -> x >= low && x <= high
  end;;
module Extended_interval :
  sig
    type t = Interval.t = Interval of int * int | Empty
    val create : int -> int -> t
    val contains : t -> int -> bool
  end
# Extended_interval.contains (Extended_interval.create 3 10) 4;;
- : bool = true
```

The difference between `include` and `open` is that we've done more than
change how identifiers are searched for: we've changed what's in the module.
If we'd used `open`, we'd have gotten a quite different result:

```ocaml env=main
# module Extended_interval = struct
    open Interval

    let contains t x =
      match t with
      | Empty -> false
      | Interval (low,high) -> x >= low && x <= high
  end;;
module Extended_interval :
  sig val contains : Extended_interval.t -> int -> bool end
# Extended_interval.contains (Extended_interval.create 3 10) 4;;
Line 1, characters 29-53:
Error: Unbound value Extended_interval.create
```

To consider a more realistic example, imagine you wanted to build an
extended version of the `Option` module, where you've added some
functionality not present in the module as distributed in
`Base`. That's a job for `include`.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/ext-option/ext_option.ml
open Base

(* The new function we're going to add *)
let apply f_opt x =
  match f_opt with
  | None -> None
  | Some f -> Some (f x)

(* The remainder of the option module *)
include Option
```

Now, how do we write an interface for this new module? It turns out
that `include` works on signatures as well, so we can pull essentially
the same trick to write our `mli`. The only issue is that we need to
get our hands on the signature for the `Option` module. This can be
done using `module type of`, which computes a signature from a module:

```ocaml file=examples/correct/ext-option/ext_option.mli
open Base

(* Include the interface of the option module from Base *)
include module type of Option

(* Signature of function we're adding *)
val apply : ('a -> 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b t
```

Note that the order of declarations in the `mli` does not need to match the
order of declarations in the `ml`. The order of declarations in the `ml`
mostly matters insofar as it affects which values are shadowed. If we wanted
to replace a function in `Option` with a new function of the same name, the
declaration of that function in the `ml` would have to come after the
`include Option` declaration.

We can now use `Ext_option` as a replacement for `Option`. If we want
to use `Ext_option` in preference to `Option` in our project, we can
create a file of common definitions, which in this case we'll call
`import.ml`.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/ext-option/import.ml
module Option = Ext_option
```

\noindent
Then, by opening `Import`, we can shadow `Base`'s `Option` module with
our extension.

```ocaml file=examples/correct/ext-option/use_import.ml
open Base
open Import

let lookup_and_apply map key x = Option.apply (Map.find map key) x
```


## Common Errors with Modules

When OCaml compiles a program with an `ml` and an `mli`, it will complain if
it detects a mismatch between the two. Here are some of the common errors
you'll run into.

### Type Mismatches

The simplest kind of error is where the type specified in the signature does
not match the type in the implementation of the module. As an example, if we
replace the `val` declaration in `counter.mli` by swapping the types of the
first two arguments: [errors/module type mismatches]{.idx}[type
mismatches]{.idx}[modules/type mismatches in]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-with-sig-mismatch/counter.mli,part=1
(** Bump the frequency count for the given string. *)
val touch : string -> t -> t
```

and we try to compile, we'll get the following error.

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-with-sig-mismatch
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
       does not match the interface .freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
       Values do not match:
         val touch :
           ('a, int, 'b) Base.Map.t -> 'a -> ('a, int, 'b) Base.Map.t
       is not included in
         val touch : string -> t -> t
       File "counter.mli", line 16, characters 0-28: Expected declaration
       File "counter.ml", line 8, characters 4-9: Actual declaration
[1]
```

### Missing Definitions

We might decide that we want a new function in `Counter` for pulling
out the frequency count of a given string.  We could add that to the
`mli` by adding the following line. [errors/missing module
definitions]{.idx}[modules/missing definitions in]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-with-missing-def/counter.mli,part=1
(** Returns the frequency count for the given string *)
val count : t -> string -> int
```

Now if we try to compile without actually adding the implementation, we'll
get this error.

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-with-missing-def
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
       does not match the interface .freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
       The value `count' is required but not provided
       File "counter.mli", line 15, characters 0-30: Expected declaration
[1]
```

A missing type definition will lead to a similar error.

### Type Definition Mismatches

Type definitions that show up in an `mli` need to match up with corresponding
definitions in the `ml`. Consider again the example of the type `median`. The
order of the declaration of variants matters to the OCaml compiler, so the
definition of `median` in the implementation listing those options in a
different order: [type definition mismatches]{.idx}[errors/module type
definition mismatches]{.idx}[modules/type definition mismatches]{.idx}

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-with-type-mismatch/counter.mli,part=1
(** Represents the median computed from a set of strings. In the case
    where there is an even number of choices, the one before and after
    the median is returned. *)
type median =
  | Before_and_after of string * string
  | Median of string

val median : t -> median
```

will lead to a compilation error.

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-with-type-mismatch
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 1:
Error: The implementation counter.ml
       does not match the interface .freq.eobjs/byte/dune__exe__Counter.cmi:
       Type declarations do not match:
         type median = Median of string | Before_and_after of string * string
       is not included in
         type median = Before_and_after of string * string | Median of string
       Constructors number 1 have different names, Median and Before_and_after.
       File "counter.mli", lines 21-23, characters 0-20: Expected declaration
       File "counter.ml", lines 17-19, characters 0-39: Actual declaration
[1]
```

Order is similarly important to other type declarations, including the order
in which record fields are declared and the order of arguments (including
labeled and optional arguments) to a function.

### Cyclic Dependencies

In most cases, OCaml doesn't allow cyclic dependencies, i.e., a collection of
definitions that all refer to one another. If you want to create such
definitions, you typically have to mark them specially. For example, when
defining a set of mutually recursive values (like the definition of `is_even`
and `is_odd` in
[Recursive Functions](variables-and-functions.html#recursive-functions){data-type=xref}),
you need to define them using `let rec` rather than ordinary `let`.
[dependencies, cyclic]{.idx}[cyclic dependencies]{.idx}[errors/cyclic
dependencies]{.idx}[modules/cyclic dependencies]{.idx}

The same is true at the module level. By default, cyclic dependencies between
modules are not allowed, and cyclic dependencies among files are never
allowed. Recursive modules are possible but are a rare case, and we won't
discuss them further here.

The simplest example of a forbidden circular reference is a module referring
to its own module name. So, if we tried to add a reference to `Counter` from
within `counter.ml`.

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-cyclic1/counter.ml,part=1
let singleton l = Counter.touch Counter.empty
```

we'll see this error when we try to build:

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-cyclic1
$ dune build freq.exe
File "counter.ml", line 18, characters 18-31:
18 | let singleton l = Counter.touch Counter.empty
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: The module Counter is an alias for module Dune__exe__Counter, which is the current compilation unit
[1]
```

The problem manifests in a different way if we create cyclic references
between files. We could create such a situation by adding a reference to
`Freq` from `counter.ml`, e.g., by adding the following line.

```ocaml file=examples/erroneous/freq-cyclic2/counter.ml,part=1
let _build_counts = Freq.build_counts
```

\noindent
In this case, `dune` will notice the error and complain explicitly about
the cycle:

```sh dir=examples/erroneous/freq-cyclic2,non-deterministic=output
$ dune build freq.exe
Error: Dependency cycle between the following files:
   _build/default/.freq.eobjs/freq.impl.all-deps
-> _build/default/.freq.eobjs/counter.impl.all-deps
-> _build/default/.freq.eobjs/freq.impl.all-deps
[1]
```

## Designing with Modules

The module system is a key part of how an OCaml program is structured. As
such, we'll close this chapter with some advice on how to think about
designing that structure effectively.

### Expose Concrete Types Rarely

When designing an `mli`, one choice that you need to make is whether to
expose the concrete definition of your types or leave them abstract. Most of
the time, abstraction is the right choice, for two reasons: it enhances the
flexibility of your design, and it makes it possible to enforce invariants on
the use of your module.

Abstraction enhances flexibility by restricting how users can interact with
your types, thus reducing the ways in which users can depend on the details
of your implementation. If you expose types explicitly, then users can depend
on any and every detail of the types you choose. If they're abstract, then
only the specific operations you want to expose are available. This means
that you can freely change the implementation without affecting clients, as
long as you preserve the semantics of those operations.

In a similar way, abstraction allows you to enforce invariants on your
types.  If your types are exposed, then users of the module can create
new instances of that type (or if mutable, modify existing instances)
in any way allowed by the underlying type. That may violate a desired
invariant *i.e.*, a property about your type that is always supposed
to be true. Abstract types allow you to protect invariants by making
sure that you only expose functions that preserve your invariants.

Despite these benefits, there is a trade-off here. In particular, exposing
types concretely makes it possible to use pattern-matching with those types,
which as we saw in
[Lists And Patterns](lists-and-patterns.html#lists-and-patterns){data-type=xref}
is a powerful and important tool. You should generally only expose the concrete
implementation of your types when there's significant value in the ability to
pattern match, and when the invariants that you care about are already
enforced by the data type itself.

### Design for the Call Site

When writing an interface, you should think not just about how easy it is to
understand the interface for someone who reads your carefully documented
`mli` file, but more importantly, you want the call to be as obvious as
possible for someone who is reading it at the call site.

The reason for this is that most of the time, people interacting with your
API will be doing so by reading and modifying code that uses the API, not by
reading the interface definition. By making your API as obvious as possible
from that perspective, you simplify the lives of your users.

There are many ways of improving readability of client code. One
example is labeled arguments (discussed in [Labeled
Arguments](variables-and-functions.html#labeled-arguments){data-type=xref}),
which act as documentation that is available at the call site.

You can also improve readability simply by choosing good names for
your functions, variant tags and record fields. Good names aren't
always long, to be clear. If you wanted to write an anonymous function
for doubling a number: `(fun x -> x * 2)`, a short variable name like
`x` is best. A good rule of thumb is that names that have a small
scope should be short, whereas names that have a large scope, like the
name of a function in a module interface, should be longer and more
descriptive.

There is of course a tradeoff here, in that making your APIs more
explicit tends to make them more verbose as well. Another useful rule
of thumb is that more rarely used names should be longer and more
explicit, since the cost of verbosity goes down and the benefit of
explicitness goes up the less often a name is used.

### Create Uniform Interfaces {#create-uniform-intefaces}

Designing the interface of a module is a task that should not be thought of
in isolation. The interfaces that appear in your codebase should play
together harmoniously. Part of achieving that is standardizing aspects of
those interfaces.

`Base`, `Core` and related libraries have been designed with a uniform
set of standards in mind around the design of module interfaces. Here
are some of the guidelines that they use.

- *A module for (almost) every type.* You should mint a module for almost
  every type in your program, and the primary type of a given module should
  be called `t`.

- *Put `t` first*. If you have a module `M` whose primary type is `M.t`, the
  functions in `M` that take a value of type `M.t` should take it as their first
  argument.

- Functions that routinely throw an exception should end in `_exn`.
  Otherwise, errors should be signaled by returning an `option` or an
  `Or_error.t` (both of which are discussed in
  [Error Handling](error-handling.html#error-handling){data-type=xref} ).

There are also standards in Base about what the type signature for specific
functions should be. For example, the signature for `map` is always
essentially the same, no matter what the underlying type it is applied to.
This kind of function-by-function API uniformity is achieved through the use
of *signature includes*, which allow for different modules to share
components of their interface. This approach is described in
[Using Multiple Interfaces](functors.html#using-multiple-interfaces){data-type=xref}.

Base's standards may or may not fit your projects, but you can improve the
usability of your codebase by finding some consistent set of standards to
apply.

### Interfaces Before Implementations

OCaml's concise and flexible type language enables a type-oriented approach
to software design. Such an approach involves thinking through and writing
out the types you're going to use before embarking on the implementation
itself.

This is a good approach both when working in the core language, where you
would write your type definitions before writing the logic of your
computations, as well as at the module level, where you would write a first
draft of your `mli` before working on the `ml`.

Of course, the design process goes in both directions. You'll often find
yourself going back and modifying your types in response to things you learn
by working on the implementation. But types and signatures provide a
lightweight tool for constructing a skeleton of your design in a way that
helps clarify your goals and intent, before you spend a lot of time and
effort fleshing it out.
