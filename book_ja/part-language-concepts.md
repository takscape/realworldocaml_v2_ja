\noindent Part I covers the language itself, opening with a guided tour
designed to provide a quick sketch of the language. Don't expect to
understand everything in the tour; it's meant to give you a taste of
many different aspects of the language, but the ideas covered there
will be explained in more depth in the chapters that follow.

After covering the core language, Part I then moves onto more
advanced features like modules, functors, and objects, which may
take some time to digest. Understanding these concepts is important,
though. These ideas will put you in good stead even beyond OCaml
when switching to other modern languages, many of which have drawn
inspiration from ML.
